The website chosen is Fair Observer (https://www.fairobserver.com).

The information i gathered was about the following :
Title: The main headline or title of each article.
Publication Date: The date when the article was published.
URL: The direct link to the article for further reading.
I choose these becouse they are the keys to analyzing the data.

The tools i used were : 

Python: The programming language used for the project.
Google Colab: An online environment for writing and executing Python code.
BeautifulSoup: A Python library used for parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
Requests: A Python library for sending HTTP requests to the target URL.
JSON: The format in which the extracted data was saved.

Missing Data: Some articles did not have a publication date or URL, so I had to account for missing or incomplete data in the script by adding checks.
Handling Large Pages: For a website with many articles on a single page, the script had to be efficient enough to handle multiple data points without crashing or taking too long.

This project was a great opportunity to practice web scraping using Python and the BeautifulSoup library.
